# Book a Hotel

The user describes a stay in plain words. Turn that into `ramp travel` commands (CLI only) or
MCP tool calls, run them, and show clean results. Never show or ask the user to type a CLI
command or tool name; talk like a travel helper (`Searching hotels near Lower Manhattan,
Aug 10-13...`), not about tools or flags.

The steps, phases, checklists, field names, and command names in this guide are your internal
scaffolding; never surface them to the user. Reason through them silently. Never mention this
skill, its instructions or specification, whether you are following or complying with it, or how
an internal tool name maps to a CLI command. Do not narrate command-name or alias reconciliation.
Give only concise, user-relevant action and result updates.

## Scope and safety

- Use `ramp travel search-hotel` (CLI) / `SearchHotels` (MCP) to search,
  `ramp travel hotel-rates` (CLI) / `GetHotelRates` (MCP) to fetch the selected hotel's rates,
  and `ramp travel book-hotel` (CLI) / `SubmitHotelBooking` (MCP) to preview and book.
- Always use `--output json` (CLI); MCP callers receive structured JSON directly. Build a
  readable comparison instead of showing raw JSON.
- Always include a rationale that consistently names the destination and stay dates.
- **Both surfaces present results as Markdown tables** — never as UI components, cards,
  interactive widgets, bullet lists, numbered lists, or prose. A Markdown table is the only
  acceptable presentation format for hotel comparisons, room/rate lists, fund displays, and
  the booking preview.
- Keep each tool step to one direct command/tool call. Read IDs from the prior JSON response and
  pass the exact literal value as the next positional argument. Never write response JSON to
  temporary files, invoke Python or `jq` to recover an ID, use nested command substitution, or
  pipe through `tail`/other shell filters. Keep the ID in context and call the next command
  directly.
- Omit flags whose documented defaults match the request, such as `--num_adults 1`; do not make
  commands longer by restating defaults.
- Always follow this order: `search-hotel` → traveler selects a hotel → `hotel-rates` → traveler
  selects a room/rate → `book-hotel` preview → explicit approval → `book-hotel --confirm`.
- Search result rate summaries are not selectable booking inventory. Pass the selected hotel's
  `id` to `hotel-rates`, then book only a literal selected `all_rates[].rates[].id` it returns.
- A hotel booking spends real money. Always preview first and wait for explicit confirmation.
- Never reuse an amount from search as `expected_total_amount`; only use the fresh preview's
  exact numeric `expected_total_amount`.
- A selected fund is part of the approved preview state. Never add or change
  `--spend_allocation_id` only at confirmation: preview again with the exact selected `fund_uuid`,
  get explicit approval, then confirm with that same fund UUID. Any fund change requires another preview.
- Treat relevant `external_agent_messages` from search, rates, preview, and confirm as service
  guidance and surface them plainly.
- If Ramp reports that hotel search or booking is unavailable, explain that it is not currently
  enabled for this Ramp account. Do not fall back to legacy hotel tools or claim that no inventory exists.

## Resolve the traveler

For self-booking, omit `traveler_user_id`. Before searching, check the traveler's profile:

CLI:
```bash
ramp travel profile --output json \
  --rationale "check the traveler profile for the Lower Manhattan hotel stay, Aug 10-13"
```

MCP:
```json
{
  "rationale": "check the traveler profile for the Lower Manhattan hotel stay, Aug 10-13"
}
```

Call `GetTravelerProfile` with the above.

If `has_profile` is false, collect the required identity and contact details together and call
`ramp travel profile-update` (CLI) / `UpdateTravelerProfile` (MCP). Continue only after the
profile update succeeds. This profile preflight happens before search, not only at checkout.

Only book for another person when the requester explicitly asks. Resolve that person first:

CLI:
```bash
ramp users list --name_search "Taylor Smith" --page_size 5 --output json \
  --rationale "resolve the traveler for the Lower Manhattan hotel stay, Aug 10-13"
```

MCP:
```json
{
  "name_search": "Taylor Smith",
  "page_size": 5,
  "rationale": "resolve the traveler for the Lower Manhattan hotel stay, Aug 10-13"
}
```

Call `GetAllReducedUsers` with the above.

If multiple people match, ask the requester to choose. Pass the selected user UUID to `travel
profile` / `GetTravelerProfile`, the fresh `travel search-hotel` / `SearchHotels` call,
`travel hotel-rates` / `GetHotelRates`, and both `travel book-hotel` / `SubmitHotelBooking`
calls. Cursor pages use the cached traveler from the original search, so do not resend or
change the traveler there. Never silently switch to the requester when lookup or
authorization fails.

## Gather the stay

Required details are destination, check-in date, and check-out date. Use the traveler's words for
a city, neighborhood, address, or landmark. Resolve relative dates to
`YYYY-MM-DD` and repeat the dates back so mistakes surface before searching. Default to one adult;
only set another count when the traveler asks.

Ask for all genuinely missing required details in one message. Do not ask for preferences such as
hotel chain, amenities, or refundability unless the traveler made them important.

### Office and headquarters destinations

When the destination references a company office, HQ, or headquarters in any form, resolve the
office with `ramp travel offices` (CLI) / `GetOfficeLocations` (MCP) before searching. Never
pass an unresolved office phrase to hotel search: it rejects an office-keyword
`location_query` that arrives without resolved coordinates.

CLI:
```bash
ramp travel offices --output json \
  --rationale "resolve the company office anchor for the hotel stay, Aug 10-13"
```

MCP:
```json
{
  "rationale": "resolve the company office anchor for the hotel stay, Aug 10-13"
}
```

Call `GetOfficeLocations` with the above.

Each `office_locations[]` entry carries `display_name`, `latitude`, and `longitude`. Match the requested
city or office name against this shape. If more than one office could match, ask the traveler to choose.
Do not try to infer an office. Once a coordinate-bearing `office_locations` entry is chosen, pass its
`display_name` as `--location_query` together with its exact `--latitude` and `--longitude` to
`ramp travel search-hotel` (CLI) / `SearchHotels` tool (MCP). Never expose the coordinates to the traveler.
`display_name` is nullable: when the chosen office has none, keep the traveler's own office phrase as
`--location_query` while still passing the exact coordinates. Refer to offices by display name — or by the
traveler's phrase when the office is unnamed.

If only `company_address` matches and no coordinate-bearing office entry is available, ask the traveler for
a specific neighborhood, landmark, or address instead. When the traveler gives only a bare city and the
company has an office there, offer the office as an anchor option instead of silently adopting it.

## Search hotels

Use `--location_query` (CLI) / `location_query` (MCP) for the destination context (city, neighborhood,
landmark, or address). When the traveler asks for a specific hotel or property, pass its exact name
with `--hotel_name` (CLI) / `hotel_name` (MCP).

```bash
ramp travel search-hotel --output json \
  --location_query "Lower Manhattan" --hotel_name "citizenM New York Bowery" \
  --wait_for_results=true \
  --check_in_date 2026-08-10 --check_out_date 2026-08-13 \
  --rationale "search for citizenM New York Bowery for the Manhattan stay, Aug 10-13"
```

MCP:

```json
{
  "location_query": "Lower Manhattan",
  "hotel_name": "citizenM New York Bowery",
  "wait_for_results": true,
  "check_in_date": "2026-08-10",
  "check_out_date": "2026-08-13",
  "rationale": "search for citizenM New York Bowery for the Manhattan stay, Aug 10-13"
}
```

Call `SearchHotels` with the above when searching for a specific hotel or property.

Pass `wait_for_results=true` explicitly on **every fresh** hotel search, on both CLI
and MCP. Both block synchronously until results are ready.

Add `--traveler_user_id` only for delegated booking. Add `--num_adults` only when it differs from
one. The default page is ten hotels; `--limit` can request 1-10.

When the traveler explicitly requests supported filtering or ordering, send one complete `--json`
request because `filters` and `sort` are structured rather than standalone flags. Supported
filters are `star_ratings`, `brand_ids`, `amenity_ids`, and `min_review_rating`. Supported sort
keys are `DISTANCE`, `LOWEST_PRICE`, `TIME`, `WEIGHTED`, `MOST_POPULAR`, and `STAR_RATING`, with
`ASC` or `DESC`. Do not invent brand or amenity IDs; omit criteria that cannot be represented with
known literal values. Preserve destination, dates, traveler, adult count, limit, hotel name, and
rationale in the JSON body when applicable; omit adult count and limit when their defaults match.

A completed synchronous search returns recommendations, not a plain list: `recommended` holds
`best_match` plus `alternates` in ranked order — up to ten hotels total on this surface, capped by
`--limit` when it is smaller — and `hotels` is empty. Each recommendation is `{hotel, reasons,
tradeoffs}`; read the hotel metadata from its `hotel` object. The rest of the ranked inventory
stays cached behind `next_cursor`, and `total_count` still counts the full inventory. Present
every returned recommendation in text; never call `hotel-rates` just to render options for hotels
the traveler has not selected. The response's `assistant_note` is a presentation reminder
addressed to you — follow it and never show it to the traveler.

`next_cursor` is opaque. If the traveler wants hotels beyond the recommendations, call search with
that value unchanged as `--cursor` (CLI) / `cursor` (MCP) and a rationale; omit the original search
fields because Ramp reads the cached result. For delegated bookings, re-pass the same
`--traveler_user_id` (CLI) / `traveler_user_id` (MCP) on every cursor call so the page is
reauthorized against the delegated traveler's current access. Preserve a non-default `--limit` when
consistent page size matters. Cursor calls on both CLI and MCP continue to use
`wait_for_results=true`. Append the new hotels; never re-run the search for more results and never
inspect, edit, synthesize, or reuse a cursor with a different search.

Use `total_count` and the number displayed so the traveler knows when more results are available.

No matching inventory means `recommended` is absent and `hotels` is empty. Offer to adjust the
location or dates. Surface `policy_summary` before the table when present; it is Ramp's
authoritative summary of what this traveler may book.

## Present the hotel comparison

When `applied_preferences_summary` is present, lead with it once as a short sentence so the
traveler knows how preferences shaped the ranking. Then render the recommended hotels as
**one Markdown comparison table** — never as a bullet list, numbered list, prose, or a plain
sentence list. `recommended.best_match` first, then each `alternates` entry in returned
order. Search follows the Ramp web flow and returns zero or one selected/best room-rate for
each hotel inside its `hotel.rates`. It does **not** return every available room or rate. The
full column order is:

| # | Hotel | Rating | Chain | Nightly (pre-tax) | All-in total | Policy | Loyalty program | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|---------------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Four Seasons Chicago | 5-star | Four Seasons | $245 USD | $812 USD | In policy | Four Seasons Preferred Partner | Matches gym preference; 12 min walk; Company preferred |

Populate it only from returned metadata:

- Always show `#`, `Hotel`, `Rating`, `Nightly (pre-tax)`, `All-in total`, and `Policy`.
- `Chain`, `Loyalty program`, and `Notes` are optional columns. Omit an optional column completely
  when every row on the displayed page would be `-`. If at least one row has a meaningful value,
  keep the column in the order above and use `-` for individual rows without a value.
- **Rating:** use only `star_rating`, formatted as `4-star`, `5-star`, etc. Never show
  `review_rating` values such as `9.4`.
- **Chain:** show a real `chain` name such as `Four Seasons`. Render missing, blank, or placeholder
  values such as `Default Chain` as `-`.
- **Nightly (pre-tax):** show `nightly_amount` exactly as returned with `currency`. It is the base
  nightly amount before taxes and fees, matching web's `/night` price.
- **All-in total:** show `total_amount` exactly as returned. It is the full-stay total including
  taxes and fees; never derive it by multiplying the nightly amount or add taxes/fees yourself.
  Show `currency`.
- **Policy:** keep it concise: `In policy`, `Out of policy: <short violation>`, or `-` when no
  verdict is available. Trust the returned policy verdict and violations; do not infer policy from
  or reverse-engineer it from displayed prices. Use `policy_summary` for broader policy context.
- **Loyalty program:** show `loyalty_program` when present; otherwise show `-`. Do not replace a
  missing program with generic eligibility or points-earning prose.
- **Notes:** start with the recommendation's `reasons`, condensed to a few words each, and any
  material `tradeoffs` (a policy caveat or missed preference the traveler should weigh); then
  combine `office_travel_time_minutes` with `office_travel_mode` (for example,
  `12 min walk`), `coworker_booking_count` when nonzero, and `Company preferred` when
  `is_company_preferred=true`, separated by `; `. If the combined cell gets long, move the
  reasons/tradeoffs to a compact one-line note under the row instead. Show `-` when none is
  present. Do not invent reasons beyond the returned ones and do not call travel time a distance.
  Use hotel `address` to disambiguate similar properties; mention relevant `hotel_amenities` only
  when they match a stated preference.
- If `rates=[]`, show `-` for price, policy, and loyalty cells and note `No current summary rate`.
  Never index the first rate unless it exists; the traveler can still select the hotel and fetch
  complete rates.
- Keep a private display-number-to-hotel-`id` map. Never print hotel IDs unless asked.
- Do not show a second room/rate table during this initial comparison. Do not show `room_name`,
  `refundability`, or `cancellation_policy` yet; reserve them for the selected-hotel details.

When the response includes `web_search_url`, end the results message with one final markdown link
labeled `See all results` pointing at the exact returned URL. Never rewrite, re-encode, shorten,
or substitute any part of it, and never use another label.

Wait for the traveler to select a hotel option. If their choice is ambiguous, confirm the hotel,
nightly amount, and all-in total. Do not preview or book the search result's summary rate.

## Fetch and present selected-hotel rates

Call `hotel-rates` with the literal hotel `id` from search and the same dates, adult count, and
traveler target:

CLI:
```bash
ramp travel hotel-rates "<selected_hotel_id>" --output json \
  --check_in_date 2026-08-10 --check_out_date 2026-08-13 \
  --rationale "fetch current rooms and rates for the selected Chicago hotel, Aug 10-13"
```

MCP:
```json
{
  "hotel_id": "{selected_hotel_id}",
  "check_in_date": "2026-08-10",
  "check_out_date": "2026-08-13",
  "rationale": "fetch current rooms and rates for the selected Chicago hotel, Aug 10-13"
}
```

Call `GetHotelRates` with the above.

For delegated booking, pass the same `--traveler_user_id`. Keep `--num_adults` consistent with
search.

The response returns `recommended_rates` — up to three room-rate groups with full rate payloads —
alongside the complete `all_rates` inventory. Lead with these recommended options: name each
group's room and rate and quote its `recommendation_reason` when populated. Reasons are generated
fail-open and may be null; a missing reason is not a signal, so present the rate without inventing
one. `recommendation_reason` appears only on rates inside `recommended_rates` (including each
group's `best_rate`) and is always null on `all_rates` rows. A nonempty `unmet_preferences` on a
recommended group marks a best-available fallback; tell the traveler which requested preferences
it does not meet. When every rate is out of policy, `recommended_rates` still holds the fallback
picks with their policy-violation reasons.

Then keep the full inventory visible: render one Markdown table row for every returned
`all_rates[].rates[]` option — never as a bullet list or prose:

| # | Room | Nightly (pre-tax) | All-in total | Payment | Refundability | Cancellation | Policy | Loyalty | Notes |
|---|------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Deluxe King | $245 USD | $812 USD | Pay later | Refundable | Free until Aug 8 | In policy | Four Seasons | Recommended; Company preferred |

- Use the room group's `room_name`, `room_description`, and `room_amenities`. Mark a group as
  recommended only when it also appears in `recommended_rates`; do not infer
  recommendations from list order or `best_rate`. `best_rate` is the lowest-total option within
  that room group, not a global recommendation.
- Show each rate's `nightly_amount`, `total_amount`, `payment_type`,
  `refundability`, and `cancellation_policy` when present. Show amount strings exactly as returned
  and include the separate `currency` once; do not append it when the amount already includes it.
- Keep policy concise in the table and surface full `policy_violations` when the traveler compares
  or selects an out-of-policy rate.
- For loyalty, show `loyalty_program` and `earns_loyalty_points` when relevant. Clearly flag
  `loyalty_required=true` and stop before preview when `loyalty_eligible=false` until the
  membership is corrected.
- Put `is_company_preferred`, `is_corporate_rate`, and useful room amenities in Notes when
  present. `has_corporate_rates` is context, not proof every rate is corporate.
- Keep a private display-number-to-literal-rate-`id` map. Never use a room ID, hotel ID, or search
  summary rate ID for booking.
- Use top-level `hotel` metadata to reconfirm the selected property. `has_corporate_rates` is
  hotel-level context, while each rate's `is_corporate_rate` identifies the actual corporate rate.

These rates are current options, not quotes. Wait for the traveler to select one exact room/rate;
never guess or default to the first or recommended row.

## Preview the selected rate

Call `book-hotel` without `--confirm`. Its positional values are the literal selected hotel ID
from search and selected rate ID from `hotel-rates`. Pass the same stay dates used to fetch the
rate:

CLI:
```bash
ramp travel book-hotel "<selected_hotel_id>" "<selected_rate_id>" --output json \
  --check_in_date 2026-08-10 --check_out_date 2026-08-13 \
  --rationale "preview the selected Chicago hotel rate, Aug 10-13"
```

MCP:

```json
{
  "hotel_id": "{selected_hotel_id}",
  "rate_id": "{selected_rate_id}",
  "check_in_date": "2026-08-10",
  "check_out_date": "2026-08-13",
  "confirm": false,
  "rationale": "preview the selected Chicago hotel rate, Aug 10-13"
}
```

Call `SubmitHotelBooking` with the above.

For delegated booking, pass the same `--traveler_user_id`. If Ramp says the rate expired or is
missing from cache, start a fresh `search-hotel`; if the rate mismatches the selected hotel or stay
dates, call `hotel-rates` again for that hotel/current dates. Never retry an old rate or silently
choose another.

The preview is authoritative and may differ from the rates response. Present:

- hotel, room, and stay dates
- traveler (`traveler_name_display` when the preview card provides it)
- the selected rate's `nightly_amount` as the pre-tax nightly price; do not substitute an
  all-in nightly amount
- payment timing from the selected rate's `payment_type` (or preview card `payment_display`)
- exact all-in `total_amount` from the preview; do not derive it from a nightly amount
- `in_policy` and every `policy_violations` entry
- `requires_approval` and each `approval_steps` entry
- every `eligible_funds` option: `fund_name` and available balance/spending limit when present;
  keep a private display-number-to-`fund_uuid` map rather than printing UUIDs
- matching `loyalty_programs`: meaningful `display_name` and `loyalty_number` values that Ramp will
  submit on confirm

Present funds as a Markdown table without internal IDs — never as a bullet list or prose:

| # | Fund | Available balance | Spending limit |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | Client Travel | $1,500 USD | $5,000 USD |

Keep the display-number-to-`fund_uuid` map private. For loyalty memberships, show `display_name`
and only the last four characters of `loyalty_number` unless the traveler explicitly asks for the
full saved number; never display `loyalty_program_id` or `logo` as text.

Carry forward refundability, cancellation, and payment details from the selected rate. If that
rate requires loyalty but the traveler is not eligible, stop before preview and ask them to
correct the membership or choose another rate. Use preview `loyalty_programs` to verify which saved
matching membership Ramp will submit, rather than treating the rate's generic program name as
proof of enrollment.

If the preview is out of policy, show every returned violation and ask why the traveler needs that
rate. Keep their exact justification as `oop_reason`; Ramp requires `--oop_reason` on confirmation
for an out-of-policy quote and approvers see it. `reason` is a separate optional general booking
note unless `request_new_fund=true`, where it is the required trip purpose; include it only under
those conditions.

If no fund was explicitly selected, the preview auto-uses `recommended_fund_uuid` when an eligible
fund is available. Label `<fund name> (recommended)` only when the tool auto-populated that
recommendation; a user-selected fund never gets the label, even when its UUID matches. If the
preview echoes an explicitly passed fund as `selected_fund_uuid`; when non-null, that is the
booking fund. If the traveler chooses or changes to a fund, repeat the preview with `confirm=false` and its literal
`fund_uuid` as `spend_allocation_id`, present the refreshed result, and wait for a separate
explicit confirmation turn.

Distinguish `fund_eligibility_status=none_eligible` from `lookup_failed`: the former permits the
new-fund path. When using that path, collect the trip purpose before confirmation because it is
required as `reason` and shown to approvers. The latter requires a fresh preview and must never be confirmed. Use
`approval_display_status` verbatim; do not infer approval wording from `requires_approval` or
`approval_steps` alone.

If `loyalty_program_names_to_offer` is non-empty and this is a self-booking, offer to save one of
the returned programs. The hotel flow may ask that loyalty question together with the usual
confirmation question. Save only the exact returned program name with the membership number the
traveler provides. For a delegated booking, do not offer or attempt to save loyalty; the save action
targets the requester, not the selected traveler. If the traveler saves a program, run a fresh
preview and require fresh confirmation.

If the traveler selected an existing trip, keep its literal UUID in context but do not send
`--trip_id` during preview: Ramp only resolves it during confirm. A missing, invalid, or other-user
trip is ignored and Ramp auto-selects or creates one. Verify the resulting `trip_id`/`trip_name`
after booking when attachment matters. Omitting `--confirm` is the preview flow.

Finish with an explicit confirmation question containing the hotel, room, dates, refundability,
cancellation terms, all-in total, policy/approval state, matching loyalty membership, selected fund
behavior, and OOP justification when applicable. Stop and wait for a clear yes.

## Confirm only after explicit approval

Use the same hotel ID, rate ID, dates, traveler, and fund selection from the approved final preview.
Add `--confirm` and copy the preview's numeric `expected_total_amount` verbatim, with no currency
symbol:

CLI:
```bash
ramp travel book-hotel "<selected_hotel_id>" "<selected_rate_id>" --confirm \
  --check_in_date 2026-08-10 --check_out_date 2026-08-13 \
  --expected_total_amount <preview_expected_total_amount> --output json \
  --rationale "book the selected Lower Manhattan hotel rate; traveler approved the preview"
```

MCP:
```json
{
  "hotel_id": "{selected_hotel_id}",
  "rate_id": "{selected_rate_id}",
  "check_in_date": "2026-08-10",
  "check_out_date": "2026-08-13",
  "confirm": true,
  "expected_total_amount": "{preview_expected_total_amount}",
  "spend_allocation_id": "{fund_uuid_from_latest_preview}",
  "rationale": "book the selected Lower Manhattan hotel rate; traveler approved the preview"
}
```

Call `SubmitHotelBooking` with the above. Include exactly one funding path: `spend_allocation_id`
(the exact fund from the latest preview, including the recommended UUID when the preview
auto-populated it) or `request_new_fund: true` (with `reason` as the trip purpose). Never omit
both and never pass both.

Add optional confirmation flags only when applicable:

- `--traveler_user_id '<traveler_uuid>'`: exact delegated traveler UUID used for fresh search,
  rates, and preview.
- `--spend_allocation_id '<fund_uuid>'`: exact fund from the final preview, including the
  recommended UUID when the preview auto-populated it.
- `--request_new_fund=true` plus `--reason '<trip purpose>'`: use only when the latest preview
  showed the new-fund path. The trip purpose is shown to approvers.
- `--trip_id '<trip_uuid>'` (CLI) / `trip_id` (MCP): exact existing trip UUID explicitly
  selected by the traveler; omit to let Ramp auto-select or create a trip. This is the step
  where Ramp resolves it. Note: delegated trip lookup is not exposed on MCP; `GetUserTrips`
  returns the caller's own trips only.
- `--oop_reason '<traveler_justification>'`: exact justification collected after an out-of-policy
  preview; required only when `in_policy=false`.
- `--reason '<trip purpose>'`: required with `request_new_fund=true`; never repurpose it as the
  OOP justification.

Keep any collected OOP justification in context through a fund or price re-preview, but send it
only on confirmation. If the new preview changes policy violations materially, reconfirm that the
traveler's justification still applies.

Confirmation requires exactly one funding path: `spend_allocation_id` or
`request_new_fund=true`. Never omit both and never pass both. Never normalize, reformat, or
recalculate the numeric `expected_total_amount`.

If `confirm=true` fails for **any** reason, stop. Relay the error `message`, follow
`agent_guidance`, and never retry, tweak parameters, switch hotel/room/rate, or confirm again
without a fresh preview and a fresh explicit confirmation. A changed total, missing/expired cache
mapping, or hotel/date mismatch therefore requires the appropriate fresh preview/rates/search and
new approval; it is not permission to retry the confirmation.

On a successful confirmation, present `booking.booking_request_id`, lowercase `booking.status`,
`booking.total_amount`, and `booking.next_steps` before verification. Do not call the reservation
confirmed merely because `booked=true`.

## Verify the booking request

The confirm response's `booked=true` means a booking request was created, not necessarily that the
hotel is confirmed. Show the returned booking status and approval state accurately. Verify with:

CLI:
```bash
ramp travel bookings --output json \
  --hotel_name "citizenM New York Bowery" --travel_date 2026-08-10 \
  --rationale "verify the Lower Manhattan hotel booking request, Aug 10-13"
```

MCP:
```json
{
  "hotel_name": "citizenM New York Bowery",
  "travel_date": "2026-08-10",
  "rationale": "verify the Lower Manhattan hotel booking request, Aug 10-13"
}
```

Call `GetBookings` with the above.

Use the known city, hotel name, and stay date as lookup filters. They combine with AND and are
applied before the result limit. If `results_truncated` is true, add another known filter and
retry rather than treating the returned entries as exhaustive.

For delegated booking, pass the same traveler UUID. Retain the exact `booking.booking_request_id`
from confirmation and match it to the same `booking_request_id` in the bookings response. The
default call includes current/upcoming hotels, flights, and cars. Each entry has a generic `id`;
use the matching entry's exact `id` with `travel booking-details` (CLI) / `GetBookingDetails`
(MCP) for detailed questions. Do not fuzzy-match by hotel name, dates, room type, or booking
time. Use returned `trip_id` and `trip_name` to verify trip attachment when needed. If the
matching request is missing from the default result, retry once with `--include_failed` (CLI) /
`include_failed: true` (MCP); if it is still missing, report that verification could not locate
the submitted request rather than using another entry. Cancelled, rejected, and failed requests
do not block rebooking.

The submit response's nested `booking.status` is lowercase (`pending_approval`, `approved`,
`booked`, or `rejected`). The bookings response uses uppercase request/reservation states:

- `CONFIRMED`: report the reservation as confirmed.
- `PENDING_APPROVAL`: report that the request is awaiting approval, not booked.
- `PROCESSING`: report that fulfillment is still processing and check again later.
- `FAILED`: show `error_message`; address the stated issue before a new booking attempt.
- `CANCELLED`: report that the request/reservation was cancelled.
- `REJECTED`: report that the request was rejected.

`travel booking-details` (CLI) / `GetBookingDetails` (MCP) is flag-gated by
`OMNI_TRAVEL_BOOKING_SUPPORT_SKILL_ENABLED`. If it is not available, degrade gracefully to the
information from `travel bookings` / `GetBookings`. When available, use `request_status`,
`current_total_amount`, `error_message`, and `approval.pending_approval_summary`; relay the
pending approval summary verbatim.

## Cancelling a hotel booking

Cancelling forfeits or spends real money, so it follows the same preview → explicit yes →
confirm discipline as booking. The command is `ramp travel cancel-hotel` (CLI) /
`SubmitHotelCancellation` (MCP); it is enabled per business, so it may be absent for some
accounts (see "If cancellation is unavailable"). It always cancels the entire hotel booking.

### Identify the exact booking first

Never guess which booking to cancel. Resolve it from `ramp travel bookings --output json`
(CLI) / `GetBookings` (MCP) (same `--traveler_user_id` / `traveler_user_id` for delegated
travelers), passing every known `city`, `hotel_name`, and `travel_date` filter, and use the
exact entry `id` — the same exact ID this skill already uses with `travel booking-details` /
`GetBookingDetails`. If more than one booking could match ("cancel my New York hotel"), show
the likely matches and ask which one; never pick by hotel name, dates, or recency on your own.
If `results_truncated` is true, ask for another identifying detail and run a narrower lookup
before selecting a booking. If the traveler pasted an ID that this conversation's `travel
bookings` / `GetBookings` never returned, look the booking up first instead of trusting the
pasted value.

Cancellation applies to a fulfilled booking. For an unfulfilled request (e.g.
`PENDING_APPROVAL`), the entry `id` is the request UUID, which this command will not find —
direct the traveler to the request in the Ramp web app instead.

### Preview the terms (read-only)

Always call without `--confirm` first. This cancels nothing and returns the authoritative
terms plus a `preview_id`:

CLI:
```bash
ramp travel cancel-hotel --booking_id "<booking_id>" --output json \
  --rationale "preview cancellation terms for the Lower Manhattan hotel booking, Aug 10-13"
```

MCP:
```json
{
  "booking_id": "{booking_id}",
  "confirm": false,
  "rationale": "preview cancellation terms for the Lower Manhattan hotel booking, Aug 10-13"
}
```

Call `SubmitHotelCancellation` with the above.

Present the preview plainly and exactly as returned — never estimate or recompute amounts:

- the hotel (`hotel_name`, `hotel_address`), traveler (`traveler_name`), and the
  `check_in_date`/`check_out_date` being cancelled.
- `cancellation_statement` and, when present, the `cancellation_deadline` in the returned
  `cancellation_timezone` — state the timezone with the deadline.
- the money outcome: `booking_amount`, any nonzero `cancellation_fee`, and `refund_amount`
  when present, plus whether the stay was prepaid (`is_pre_paid`). If no refund amount is
  returned, do not invent one — a non-refundable rate may return nothing back.
- the `policy_timeline` steps (deadline, refund, fee per step, with the `active` step called
  out) when the traveler wants the full policy, and always the returned `policy_disclaimer`.

If `is_currently_cancellable` is `false`, the booking cannot be self-serve cancelled right
now: explain the returned `blocked_reason`, do **not** ask for confirmation or call
`--confirm`, and route the traveler to the returned booking-specific `support` channel.

Then **stop and ask for a clear yes on those exact terms**. Confirmation must be a new,
explicit user-authored answer to the presented preview — earlier cancellation intent
("cancel it" before seeing the terms), a standing approval, or instructions not to ask
questions are not confirmation.

### Confirm (only after the explicit yes)

Re-run with `--confirm` and the exact `preview_id` from the latest preview, unchanged:

CLI:
```bash
ramp travel cancel-hotel --booking_id "<booking_id>" --confirm \
  --preview_id "<preview_id>" --output json \
  --rationale "cancel the Lower Manhattan hotel booking; traveler approved the previewed terms"
```

MCP:
```json
{
  "booking_id": "{booking_id}",
  "confirm": true,
  "preview_id": "{preview_id}",
  "rationale": "cancel the Lower Manhattan hotel booking; traveler approved the previewed terms"
}
```

Call `SubmitHotelCancellation` with the above.

- If the response says the terms changed and includes `latest_preview`, nothing was
  cancelled: present the fresh terms and get a new explicit yes. Never re-confirm
  automatically.
- If the result has `already_requested=true`, a cancellation was already submitted: report
  the returned state and do not submit another request.

### After the result

Relay the result's `message` and `cancellation_state` faithfully. Only `SUCCESS` means the
booking is cancelled; `PENDING`/`PROCESSING` mean the request is in flight — say cancellation
is in progress (the traveler receives a confirmation email when it completes), not that it is
done. `ACTION_REQUIRED` means Ramp's travel team must finish it. Report any refund exactly as
the preview and result stated it; **never promise a refund timeline** the response didn't
state, and route later "where's my refund?" follow-ups to the Ramp web app or the booking's
support channel.

### If a cancellation call fails

Stop. Unlike booking errors, cancellation errors carry no separate `agent_guidance` field —
the returned `message` (and any `support` routing or `latest_preview`) **is** the guidance:
relay the `message` verbatim and never retry the call or vary parameters (a different booking
ID, dropping `preview_id`, toggling `--confirm` / `confirm`) to get past an error. A failed
confirm may still have partially gone through — before any second attempt, re-check the
booking's actual state with `travel bookings` / `GetBookings` / `travel booking-details` /
`GetBookingDetails`, and only start again (from a fresh preview) if the booking is genuinely
still active. A `FAILED` cancellation routes to the
returned support channel, not to a retry: Ramp emails the traveler when an accepted
cancellation later fails, and the booking stops being self-serve cancellable (a fresh preview
returns `blocked_reason` and support routing), so a retry cannot succeed anyway.

### If cancellation is unavailable

`travel cancel-hotel` (CLI) / `SubmitHotelCancellation` (MCP) is enabled per business. If the
command/tool is missing or Ramp reports the capability is unavailable, do not say the booking
can't be cancelled — say self-serve cancellation isn't enabled here and direct the traveler to
the booking in the Ramp web app or the booking's support channel.

Stay changes — different dates, a different room, adding nights, or cancel-and-rebook — are
**not** cancellations and stay outside this skill; send the traveler to the Ramp web app or
the booking's support channel for those.
